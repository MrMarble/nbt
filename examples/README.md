# Example Files: Not all mine

The `bigtest.nbt` and `hello.nbt` files are not originally mine;
I retrieved them from some random wiki which claims that they are
the files Notch originally posted to minecraft.net some years ago,
which are otherwise unavailable. I don't know who if anyone has
copyright on them (probably Notch?) but I feel like the
interoperability and testing usage justifies their inclusion. If
someone has a credible claim of copyright on these and wants them
gone, feel free to let me know.
